any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>\n      <p>The following privacy policy

We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>\n      <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>\n      <p>\n        I.

Information about the data processing</h3>\n      <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>\n\n      <h4>Server data</h4>\n      <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>\n      <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>\n      <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>\n      <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>\n\n      <h4>Cookies</h4>\n      <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>\n      <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>\n      <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>\n      <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>\n      <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>\n      <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>\n      <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>\n      <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>\n      <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>\n      <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>\n      <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>\n      <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.</p>\n\n      <h4>Newsletter</h4>\n      <p>If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for this purpose, i.e. your email address and, optionally, your name and address, will be sent to us. We also store the IP address of your computer and the date and time of your registration. During the registration process, we will obtain your consent to receive this newsletter and the type of content it will offer, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected will be used exclusively to send the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.</p>\n      <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>\n      <p>You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained in each newsletter.</p>\n\n      <h4>Contact</h4>\n      <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>\n      <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>\n      <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>\n\n      <h4>Google Analytics</h4>\n      <p>We use Google Analytics on our website.

The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>\n      <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>\n      <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>\n      <p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,</a></p>\n      <p>including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.</p>\n      <p>In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>\n      <p>in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.</p>\n\n      <h4>Google Fonts</h4>\n      <p>Our website uses Google Fonts to display external fonts. This is a service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (hereinafter: Google).</p>\n      <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a></p>\n      <p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.</p>\n      <p>To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to the Google server in the USA is established whenever our website is accessed.</p>\n      <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimization and economic operation of our site.</p>\n      <p>When you access our site, a connection to Google is established from which Google can identify the site from which your request has been sent and to which IP address the fonts are being transmitted for display.</p>\n      <p>Google offers detailed information at</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated</a></p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>\n      <p>in particular on options for preventing the use of data.</p>\n\n      <h4>MailChimp - Newsletter</h4>\n      <p>We offer you the opportunity to register for our free newsletter via our website.</p>\n      <p>We use MailChimp, a service of The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA, hereinafter referred to as \"The Rocket Science Group\".</p>\n      <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&amp;status=Active\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&amp;status=Active</a></p>\n      <p>the Rocket Science Group guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United States.

In addition, your IP address and the date and time of your registration will be saved. During the registration process, your consent to receive this newsletter will be obtained together with a concrete description of the type of content it will offer and reference made to this privacy policy.</p>\n      <p>The newsletter then sent out by The Rocket Science Group will also contain a tracking pixel called a web beacon. This pixel helps us evaluate whether and when you have read our newsletter and whether you have clicked any links contained therein. In addition to further technical data, such as data about your computer hardware and your IP address, the data processed will be stored so that we can optimize our newsletter and respond to the wishes of our readers. The data will therefore increase the quality and attractiveness of our newsletter.</p>\n      <p>The legal basis for sending the newsletter and the analysis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>\n      <p>You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect.
